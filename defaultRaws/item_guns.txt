	[GUN] hacky, puts errors in the error log but that gets filled with garbage anyway. could use non-[] tags and parse the files myself but...
	[INACCURACY:0]  Added to shell spread. NOTE: Per projectile! Increasing this increases the size of shotgun spread so not appropriate for making guns that are hard to *aim* accurately. For that I should add another attribute (maybe do some renaming) and have perturbDirection used twice in the lua file. ...I hope you have word wrap on lol
