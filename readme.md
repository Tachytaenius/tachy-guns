# Tachy Guns

To install:
- Merge `raw/` with your DF(Hack) installation's `raw/`.
	This is the scripts that actually give functionality to the content.
- Pick a content pack from `content-packs/` and merge its `raw/` with your DF(Hack) installation's `raw/`.
- In the content pack's directory, `add-to-entity.txt` contains raw text that you paste into the entity definition for the entity you want to be able to use guns, so don't forget that.

Behaviour around the content added by the gun mod may break if the script is not on. It will leave a message in the console ("Tachy Guns enabled!") when activated.

Notes:
- Lead doesn't work very well for bullets (mostly bruising, though it is lethal) due to DF's own internal mechanics.
