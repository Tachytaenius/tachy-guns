# Barrels Content Pack

## Installation

This pack's `add-to-entity.txt` is optional, as the content packs that depend on this one have `TOOL` tokens for the barrels that they use while not including unused barrels.
Not using the `add-to-entity.txt` of this content pack would make caravans not bring unusable gun barrels.

## Manufacturing

There are 9 different barrel types, and they are all added to entity as tools, so you can forge them in "other objects" at a metalsmith's forge.
They are:

- Short small barrel
- Medium-length small barrel
- Long small barrel
- Short medium barrel
- Medium-length medium barrel
- Long medium barrel
- Short large barrel
- Medium-length large barrel
- Long large barrel
