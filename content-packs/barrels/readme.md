# Barrels Content Pack

## Manufacturing

There are 9 different barrel types, and they are all added to entity as tools, so you can forge them in "other objects" at a metalsmith's forge.
They suffer from the same problem as high/low boots do in vanilla, which is that item subtype adjectives are not shown by the item creation jobs they generate, but that means they have the same solutions.
You could either use `gui/gm-editor` to poke around and see if your job is on the right subtype, or refer to the order that they appear in in-game using the default `add-to-entity.txt`:

- Short small barrel
- Medium-length small barrel
- Long small barrel
- Short medium barrel
- Medium-length medium barrel
- Long medium barrel
- Short large barrel
- Medium-length large barrel
- Long large barrel
