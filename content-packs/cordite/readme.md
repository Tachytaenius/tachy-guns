## Cordite

All reactions in the production of cordite take place at an alchemist's laboratory.
They use the alchemist labour.
Sometimes reagents will be frozen at normal operating temperatures and the reaction won't be able to proceed, so consider doing work above magma or some other temperature control method.

Cordite bars are the propellant.
Each bar is produced with a dimension of 150 and is used up like a bar of soap is by ammo manufacturing reactions.
It is made from a vial of nitroglycerin and a glob of guncotton.

Nitroglycerin is made from a vial of sulphuric acid (called oil of vitriol), a vial of nitric acid (called spirit of nitre (niter in-game)), and a vial of glycerol.

Sulphuric acid is made from brimstone.

Nitric acid is made from sulphuric acid and either shale for alum or saltpetre.

Glycerol is extracted from plants or seeds that can be pressed, and is put in a vial.

Guncotton is made from a cotton plant, a vial of sulphuric acid, and a vial of nitric acid.
