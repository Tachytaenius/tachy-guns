## Manufacturing Guns

This is all done at a gunsmith's workshop using the mechanic labour.

It is simply a log of wood combined with a medium-length barrel of whichever size to create a handgonne.

## Guns

There is one type of handgonne for each size, and the sizes are small, medium, and large.
Each one has a fire time of twice that of a crossbow (the think counter is multiplied by 2, so skill is factored in).
All handgonnes use muzzle-loaded ammo.
Due to random spin imparted on the projectile(s) upon firing, the handgonnes are less accurate than the bow/crossbow.
