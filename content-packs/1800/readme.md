## Manufacturing Guns

At a gunsmith's workshop you can create 10 flints per chert boulder and 10 frizzens per steel bar, using the stonecraft and metalcraft labours respectively.

Making the guns themselves is also done at a gunsmith's workshop, and uses the mechanic labour.
Flintlock guns require a flint (chert) and a frizzen (steel) but are faster to reload than matchlock guns.
Matchlock guns require a serpentine (the lever) which, because it can be made from any metal, is added to entites as a tool, not a specific reaction.

## Guns

All fire times listed are multipliers for the firer's think counter, i.e. they take that many times longer to reload than a bow/crossbow.
All guns listed are manual and use muzzle-loaded ammo.
Due to random spin imparted on the projectile(s) upon firing a smoothbore gun, only the rifle has accuracy that matches the bow/crossbow.

- Flintlock pistol: small, fire time 1.5
- Flintlock rifle: medium, fire time 3.5
- Flintlock blunderbuss: large, fire time 1.5
- Matchlock pistol: small, fire time 2
- Matchlock rifle: medium, fire time 4
- Matchlock blunderbuss: large, fire time 2
